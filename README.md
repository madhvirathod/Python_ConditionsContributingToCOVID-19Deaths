# Python_ConditionsContributingToCOVID-19Deaths

##  Introduction

 This project explores various aspects of COVID-19 data, focusing on conditions contributing to COVID-19 deaths, correlations between conditions, geographical analysis of death rates, and **statistical and machine learning analysis**. The data covers the period from 2020 to 2023 across different states in the USA. The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted global health. Insights into contributing conditions guide targeted health interventions and policy decisions to reduce mortality rates and improve public health outcomes.

## Key Questions and Objective

To identify patterns and correlations in COVID-19 mortality data to guide targeted health interventions and policy decisions.

* What are the most common conditions contributing to COVID-19 deaths in different age groups?
* Which satates have the highest and lowest prevalence of specific conditiond contributing to COVID-19 deaths?
* Are there any notable seasonal patterns or trends in COVID-19 deaths or in the prevalence of specific conditions contributing to COVID-19 deaths?
* What factors are most predictive of COVID-19 death rates?

## Data and Tools

Conditions Contributing to COVID-19 Deaths, by State and Age, Provisional 2020-2023 - Catalog (data.gov).This Dataset includes information about Year, Month, State, conditions, Age Groups, COVID-19 deaths, and Number of Mentions.

The Data was analysed using python(Jupyter Notebook) with the following libraries
* Pandas: For data analysis
* NumPy:  For mathematical equations
* Seaborn: For data visualization
* Matplotlib: For data visualization
* Scipy: For data equations
* Folium: For Geospatial data visualization

## Folders

 There are mainly three folders
1. Project Management: It contains Project Brief and Data Source Summar
2. Scripts: It contains Jupyter Notebook's coding for analysis
3. Analysis: It contains the visualizations
